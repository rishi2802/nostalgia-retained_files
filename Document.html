            <p>In hindsight, was Courage the Cowardly Dog really meant for children? The colourful dystopian world of “nowhere”, where Courage lived with his farmer owners, the lovely Muriel and grumpy Eustace, seemed almost apocalyptic. Add to that the trios' daily struggles of being visited by aliens and other supernatural beings, and the whole thing is a plot for a horror sci-fi movie. With four seasons of (fittingly) 13 episodes each, Courage the Cowardly Dog was a favourite of the 90s.</p>

        <li class="subhead"><h3>Tom & Jerry:</h3></li>
        <p>There can be nothing more timeless and classic than the all-time favourite notorious cat and mouse duo, Tom and Jerry. With the original production ending in 1967, there have been multiple spin-offs made and the TV shows continue to present them. Tom continuously tried to harm Jerry, who very cleverly dodged all obstacles and got his own way. With Jerry stuffing explosives inside Tom or Tom clipping his eyelashes to stay awake, the show made no logic whatsoever. However, the utter nonsense was what we all enjoyed and still do. Special mention goes to the times when Tom and Jerry realised how much they missed each other, during each other’s absence. Do you find similarities with your bittersweet relations with your siblings and best friends?</p>

        <li class="subhead"><h3>Scooby Doo:</h3></li>
        <p>Who didn’t love the all-time famous, the talking brown Great Dane, his friends and their adventures made while solving supernatural mysteries? And can you ever forget the iconic call “Scooby Dooby Dooooooo”? What we adored the most about the show was probably the bond that Scooby shared with his friends, especially Shaggy. The bond was not of an owner-dog relation, but something more beautiful and intimate... something all dog parents would relate to. And of course, Scooby and Shaggy losing their minds over supernatural things, Daphne getting into trouble, Fred trying to take all the credit, and Velma ultimately solving the case, all contributed to this fun, exciting and spooky show! Although unanimated movies were made, nothing beats the original series.</p>
